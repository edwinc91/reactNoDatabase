# reactNoDatabase

A little ReactJS App that I'm making as I make the first steps to learn this awesome library.

As I'm taking my first steps, I have decided to just learn React without using anything else, such as Flux.

Not sure what I'll be actually turning this into, but for now, it is just like a type of "sandbox-mode" app, where I'll fiddle with it as I learn more and more.

Once I'm more confident, I'll think about what to actually turn this into.
